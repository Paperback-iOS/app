## Help contribute to the website

### Edit existing pages
Editing existing pages is very easy, just go to it on the website then press the "Help us improve this page" link in the bottom left of it.
I recommend previewing the code in using the [markdown-it live editor](https://markdown-it.github.io/) as they're functionally similiar.

### Adding new pages
Pretty much just keep the current structure, preferably don't add anything under FAQ, just edit the README.md for that. If you're adding new guides then go to [nav.js](https://github.com/FaizanDurrani/Paperback/blob/master/src/.vuepress/config/nav.js) and edit it in, follow the current example of `Getting started`, shouldn't be too hard.

### Building local enviroment
Pretty much just fork the repo, clone it to your computer then do a `npm install` then `vuepress dev src`/`npm run serve`.
